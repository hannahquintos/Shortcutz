# Shortcutz

## Description:
This application will be a word association game involving various keyboard shortcuts such as ctrl + c, ctrl + v, and ctrl + x. Different graphics will appear on the screen that represent the words copy, paste, cut, etc. The goal is for the user to type the keyboard shortcut that corresponds to the graphic that appears. For instance, if a graphic of a pair of scissors appears, the user would need to type ctrl + x. If a graphic of toothpaste appears, the user would need to type ctrl + v. The cumulative time it takes the user to complete 20 shortcuts will be tracked. The user’s high score (shortest time) will be stored with cookies or local storage.

Version/level 1 will use the actual words to represent each of the shortcuts (copy, paste, cut).
